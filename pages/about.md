# About the Code@MS-CC Student Hackathon
<br>
The Minority Serving - Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (MS-CC) is pleased to host its first Annual Meeting on May 10-11, 2023, and its first Student Hackathon for students attending historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) <img align="right" width="300px" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/imgs/CodeatMS-CC-headerlogo-2.png"> on May 9-10, 2023.


The MS-CC Hackathon is an opportunity for students who are currently enrolled at an HBCU or TCU to come together, learn new skills, and collaboratively apply those new skills to a particular problem in a defined amount of time. 


Students will work with two instructors from the Texas Advanced Computing Center — Charlie Dey, Director of Training and Professional Development, and Je’aime Powel, Senior Systems Administrator — to learn about and apply the SIR Model to different problems. Students just need a laptop and an interest in learning a new skill set. Experience in coding and programming language is not required.


The MS-CC Annual Meeting is a gathering of your peers, practitioners, community-builders, advocates, and leaders from HBCUs and TCUs. Due to capacity restrictions, we are currently limiting registrations to MS-CC participants from HBCUs, TCUs, and those who are involved with the MS-CC Annual Meeting program.


We hope you’ll join us in Atlanta as we present how the MS-CC, in partnership with Internet2 and with funding support from the National Science Foundation, is promoting advanced cyberinfrastructure (IT for research) capabilities for our community, with a focus on supporting you and your campus in improving learning environments and achieving research goals.
